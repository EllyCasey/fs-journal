# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | Git is helpful in a multitude of ways, including the sharing of entire projects and the hosting of static sites. It allows multiple people to potentially be working on the same project at the same time with their changes updating more fluidly |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | Creating a new folder |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | pseudo-classes change the "resting" state of an element. They facilitate changes to an element when certain conditions are met. So an element can appear a certain way until something happens to it, like the screen size changing |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Specificity determines the 'importance' of code. It allows some code to 'run-over' other conditions to change the outcome. For example, a line of code with a specificity of (0,0,1) could be effectively replaced by a line of code with the same perameters if its specificity is say, (0,1,0) |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | The specificity is so high that it will run over any sort of code that may be attempting to change a different element or condition.|

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | Property, name and value |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Design is aesthetic; if people don't like what they're looking at, they will stop looking. Design that is relatable makes people stick around, and that condition can be met through  things like recognizable characters or emotionally invoking content. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Wireframing in environments like Figma can be very helpful. It allows a programmer to get a sort of blueprint, either for themselves or a client in order to map out the desired end result of a project. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Yes, I do think wireframing is worth the energy and time. It ultimately cuts down on time in a real world situation with  a client or company, allowing for an outline to be made without the immediate need for line-by-line coding that could end up being completely changed. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | Display flex is extremely helpful in allowing for the dynamic movement and repositioning of elements on a webpage. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | Margins, borders, padding, and content |
