# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | Asychronous code is non-linear, so multiple aspects of that code can run at the same time.  |

02. What is an event listener?

  > | A piece of code that waits for a specific action to occur before it runs. |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | REST is a way to handle function parameters, it allows us to show an infinite number of arguments as an array. |

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | A callback is a function that is passed as an argument, and a higher order function accepts the callback as an argument and returns a function as its value. |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | A promise is an object that will produce a value, however trycatches are used to prevent that promise from running if an error occurs. |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | POST, GET, DELETE |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | Application Programming Interface |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | Perform a trycatch |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | It helps organize code, grouping like information and allowing it to become more reusable. |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | A 'Bad Request', error that occurs or is percieved to occur client-side |
